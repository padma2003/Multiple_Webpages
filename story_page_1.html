    <h3><p style="color:silver;"><img src="https://wallpapercave.com/dwp1x/wp10373804.jpg" alt="Ironman Photo" style="float:left;width:450px;height:300px;border-radius: 50px;"><b>The Avengers, American comic strip superhero team whose frequently changing roster often included some of the most popular characters in the Marvel Comics universe. Billed as “Earth’s mightiest super-heroes,” the team was created by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby, and it debuted in The Avengers no. 1 . The Avengers follows Nick Fury and the spy agency S. H. I. E. L. D. recruiting Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, Bruce Banner, Thor, Natasha Romanoff and Clint Barton to form a team capable of stopping Thor's brother Loki from subjugating Earth.</b></p></h3>

    <h3><p style="color:silver;"><b>After being exiled from the Nine Realms following his actions in Asgard, Loki wanders the periphery of outer space before coming into contact with The Other, the servant of a mysterious warlord. The Other makes a deal with Loki: in exchange for recovering the Tesseract, a powerful energy source being studied by S.H.I.E.L.D. on Earth, his master promises to give Loki command over the Chitauri, a warmongering race of cyborgs so that he may conquer humanity. Seeing this as a chance for greatness, Loki accepts. On Earth, Nick Fury, Maria Hill, Phil Coulson, Erik Selvig, and Clint Barton are called to the Joint Dark Energy Mission Facility in the Mojave Desert, where Dr. Selvig is researching the Tesseract. The Tesseract has recently begun emitting strange quantities of energy on its own accord, prompting the facility to be evacuated.</b></p></h3>
    <h3><p style="color:silver;"><b>Before any necessary precautions can be made, the Tesseract activates, opening a portal from which Loki appears. Announcing his intention to conquer Earth, Loki steals the Tesseract. Despite orders from the World Security Council to proceed with "Phase 2," Fury sends Natasha Romanoff to locate Bruce Banner, who has been living in Kolkata, India as a doctor. Agent Coulson is sent to recruit Tony Stark. Both of them are hired to help locate the Tesseract. Fury himself meets with Steve Rogers, informing him of Loki's theft of the Tesseract, requesting his help in recovering it and subduing the invader. All three men accept the offer, though Rogers is reluctant to do anything involving the Tesseract after his experiences with it in World War II. Banner is also hesitant to assist, fearing that his alter-ego, the Hulk, may cause mayhem.</b></h3>

    <h3><p style="color:silver;"><b>Romanoff, Coulson, Rogers, and Banner meet on the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier before it goes airborne. Dr. Banner is escorted to his lab after a brief meeting with Fury; Banner has been consulted to trace the gamma signature that the Tesseract radiates. After spending some time tracking the whereabouts of the Tesseract on the Helicarrier, a man of Loki's description is located in Europe.</b></p></h3>
    <h3><p style="color:silver;"><b>Romanoff and Rogers arrive to apprehend Loki, with Rogers and Loki engaging in an even fight until the timely intervention of Stark, who forces Loki to surrender. After capturing him, they board a Quinjet and start their return trip to the Helicarrier. A lightning storm suddenly forms, and Thor appears, transported to Earth by Odin and Heimdall's dark magic.Thor takes Loki from the team's custody and carries him to a nearby forest. Thor attempts to persuade Loki into abandoning his campaign and returning to Asgard, but Loki, blinded by his jealousy of Thor and contempt toward Odin, refuses. Stark flies in and attacks Thor, engaging him in a battle that levels part of the forest. Before any further damage can be done, Rogers intervenes and attempts to get Thor to stand down. Thor responds by lunging at Rogers with Mjølnir, only for the captain's shield to absorb the blow. Thor finally agrees to work with the humans and joins them in bringing Loki to the Helicarrier.Rogers, annoyed by Stark's erratic behavior and disrespect toward authority, tries to get him to follow orders more carefully, which instigates a rivalry between the two.</b></p></h3>
    <h3><p style="color:silver;"><b>Rogers and Stark eventually overcome their aggressors and get the Helicarrier airborne again. However, the victory is bittersweet as Loki escapes and Coulson dies from his injury.ury attempts to use Coulson's death to motivate the Avengers into cooperating as a team.Stark arrives first and confronts Loki.Loki unsuccessfully tries to possess Stark, as his Arc Reactor physically blocks the scepter's power, and instead throws Stark through a window. Fortunately, Stark manages to activate his Mark VII armor, which attaches to Stark before he can hit the ground. Stark then attempts to incapacitate Loki, but Selvig's device initiates, opening a portal above New York. The Chitauri fleet emerges, beginning Loki's invasion.</b></p></h3>

    <h3><p style="color:silver;"><b>Meanwhile, the World Security Council attempts to end the invasion by launching a nuclear missile at Manhattan. Iron Man intercepts the missile and takes it through the portal toward the Chitauri fleet before running out of power and plummeting back to Earth. The Hulk catches Stark as he falls, while the Chitauri fleet is decimated by the nuclear explosion, effectively disabling the Chitauri forces on Earth. Romanoff then closes the portal, the battle finally won.The world, changed forever, is taken over by the idea of a superhero team. The Avengers become the center of media attention, admired by the public as heroes.Afterward, the Avengers diverge, though Fury notes that at such a time that a new world-threatening menace emerges, the team will reassemble.</b></p></h3>
    <h3><p style="color:silver;"><b>Meanwhile, The Other meets with his master, Thanos, and informs him of Loki's failure. He shares his concerns over the strength of Earth's heroes, commenting that attempting to rechallenge them would be deadly. Thanos smiles sadistically. Before disassembling, the Avengers gathered at an empty Shawarma Palace and ate in silence.</b></p></h3>
